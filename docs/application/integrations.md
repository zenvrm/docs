## Smart Controller Hardware Compatibility List
A broad variety of Zigbee and Z-Wave Smart lock integrations have been tested with Vera and Samsung smart home controllers. If the lock can be programmed with a pin, it should be supported. If you have a lock and would like to test supportability, please send us an email and we will work with you to test it and see if it can be integrated.
