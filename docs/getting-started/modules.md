# Overview
After onboarding a property data will start populating into the various sections within 30 minutes. Please refer to the advanced section

## Dashboard
This section provides various information about the property including any alerts you may have for your account. Information about upcoming guests, monthly revenue, lock battery levels, and thermostat details can be found here. 

If you have multiple properties, the data can be filtered by clicking the :material-chevron-up: symbol at the top of the page.   

:clipboard: This type of filter for properties is commonly used throughout the tool along with :material-filter-outline:.  

## Inbox
Provides consolidated messages for guest reservations and communication between staff members you've assigned to your account. The filter allows selecting a specific property and details of the reservation. If you have automation templates assigned to the property, they will also show up here in the "Saved Replies."

## Reservations
Provides basic details on all reservations. From here you can see your upcoming check-ins and details of past reservations. The ability to message guests directly from this section is available as well from the actions section.

## Calendar
Provides reservation and task data. Again, the filter here will allow you to drill down to a specific property. The ability to block dates and modify pricing is available from here. You can also create calendar export links to provide to housekeepers or other staff members as necessary.  

:clipboard: If you export a calendar, please be sure you filter on the property you'd like to export for, otherwise full data of all 
properties attached to your account will be provided.

## Properties
Shows existing properties on the account, allows you to add a new property, and merge existing properties.

:clipboard: Merging properties is useful for your property being attached to multiple travel agencies, such as Airbnb and VRBO.

## Tasks
Shows existing tasks in the system and associated details. Provides the ability to upload photos or invoicing for record keeping and tracking.

## Staff
Provides the ability to create staff members to assign to properties. From here, you can control what types of roles they are assigned.

## Automation
The heart and soul of Zenvrm is found here where you'll find the core automation capabilities of the platform.
* Automate messages or responses based on different times or status in the reservation (from inquiry, requests, to confirmed reservations)
* Configure smart locks and code validity for guests and staff members
* Automate tasks to staff members such as housekeeping events
* Configure thermostats to provide comfortable temperature upon guest arrival and eco energy savings when vacant
* Set thresholds and notifications for noise monitoring systems and party detection

## Reports
Shows data on occupancy and payouts.

## Settings
Manage notifications and update account settings.

## Integrations
From here, add any of the smart home or third party integrations the platform supports.  

:clipboard: We are constantly adding new integrations and working on feature releases. Over time, the integration list will continue to grow.
